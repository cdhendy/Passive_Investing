Module 7 - Challenge 7 : Passive Investing
==========================================

## Purpose

 The purpose of this notebook is to build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library, and then analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

---

## Technologies

Jupyter notebooks and the Pandas data analysis library were used in the creation of this project. .

---

## Installation Guide

First, install the jupyter and pandas libraries. In your terminal or command shell install the following packages: 

```python
pip install jupyter
```

```python
pip install pandas
```

```python
pip install numpy
```

```python
pip install hvplot
```

```python
pip install sqalchemy
```

Additionally Voila was used to create a interactive visualization for the project.

This notebook was created using python 3.7.10. There were a number of issues with the packages within this specific conda environment, and I definitely recommend taking time to troubleshoot any package discrepencies that may arise.

## Demonstration

In the terminal type the following:

```python
voila passive_investing.ipynb
```

![Gitbash](Resources/gitbash.gif)]

The results should then display in your browser as follows:
