Module 7 - Challenge 7 : Passive Investing
==========================================

## Purpose

 The purpose of this notebook is to build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library, and then analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

---

## Technologies

Jupyter notebooks and the Pandas data analysis library were used in the creation of this project.

---

## Installation Guide

First, install the jupyter and pandas libraries. In your terminal or command shell install the following packages: 

```python
pip install jupyter
```

```python
pip install pandas
```

```python
pip install numpy
```

```python
pip install hvplot
```

```python
pip install sqlalchemy
```

Additionally Voila was used to create a interactive visualization for the project.

This notebook was created using python 3.7.10. There were a number of issues with the packages within this specific conda environment, and I definitely recommend taking time to troubleshoot any package discrepencies that may arise. 

---
## Demonstration

Using terminal or Gitbash, CD to the correct folder that contains the notebook file, then type the following:

```python
voila passive_investing.ipynb
```

![Gitbash](Resources/gitbash.gif)

The results should then display in your browser as follows:

## Conclusion

Contained within the notebook are the results of the analysis.
